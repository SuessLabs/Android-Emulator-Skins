# Android Emulator Skins

Slimmed down Samsung's Emulator Skins!

Like most Android VM Skins, they can be too bulky around the edges. Samsung is no stranger to this despite having devices with beautiful trimmed edges, instead using a giant background with a full keyboard and additional buttons.

If you're like me and you like slim and trim emulators, continue forward!
